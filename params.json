So you can easily extend *every single aspect* of the text editor, with full control. The only part not written in Lua is the part that draws the characters super fast, which leads me to the next feature:\r\n\r\n### Just a grid of monospace characters\r\n\r\nIt's just a grid of text. That's it. There's no fancy GUI to manipulate. This makes it:\r\n\r\n- Fast as lightning\r\n- Super low on memory\r\n- Dead-simple to program for\r\n\r\nIt won't slow down your older desktop, and it won't fry your new laptop's CPU and GPU.\r\n\r\n## Start hacking it\r\n\r\nChaos's API uses [Lua](http://phrogz.net/lua/LearningLua_FromJS.html).\r\n\r\nWhen Chaos launches, it runs `~/.chaos/init.lua`.\r\n\r\nFull API docs coming soon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
