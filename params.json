We can extend *every single aspect* of the\r\ntext editor, with full control. The only part written in native code\r\nis the part that draws the characters super fast, which leads me to\r\nthe next feature...\r\n\r\n## Just a grid of characters\r\n\r\nIt's just a grid of fixed-width text. That's it. There's no fancy GUI\r\nto manipulate. This has some very clear advantages over text editors\r\nwith fancy rendering engines.\r\n\r\n#### Extremely efficient on resources\r\n\r\nDraws fast as lightning, with a negligible re-drawing cost. Super low\r\non memory. Isn't going to burn out your new laptop's CPU, and isn't\r\ngoing to run sluggishly on your 3-year-old desktop computer.\r\n\r\n#### Dead-simple graphics API\r\n\r\nIt's super easy to write code that draws exactly the kind of thing you\r\nwant to, within the limitations. Anyone can hack on the rendering\r\ninternals, since it lacks the complexity of WebKit. And it's\r\n[not going to look ugly again every 6 months][^1], unlike *every\r\nwebsite*.\r\n\r\n#### It doesn't have to be ugly\r\n\r\nForeground and background colors are specified using 6-digit hex\r\ncodes, just like in CSS, so you get way more color than you do in\r\nterminal emulators. Plus, there are many aesthetically pleasing\r\nmonospace fonts.\r\n\r\n#### Simplicity over everything\r\n\r\nThis does have its trade-offs, that's true: you can't read your code\r\nin Arial since the font must be monospace, you can't do super fancy\r\nCSS-17 animation tricks, and you can't draw rounded rectangles. But\r\nit's quite a worthwhile trade-off to get this level of simplicity, and\r\nall its accompanying benefits.\r\n\r\n## How's it different?\r\n\r\n#### Compared to terminal-based editors:\r\n\r\n* Way more than 256-colors\r\n* Perfectly precise modifier detection\r\n* Modifiers and keys are separate\r\n* Much simpler drawing API\r\n\r\n#### Compared to GUI-heavy editors:\r\n\r\n* Much simpler drawing API\r\n* Completely customizable\r\n\r\n#### Compared to Emacs:\r\n\r\n* Uses a mainstream extension language\r\n* Aims to have sane, modern defaults\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nBecause Chaos is still in early development, only the ground-work has\r\nbeen laid out, and the basic text editing functionality still needs\r\nwork. Therefore it's not quite usable at this moment.\r\n\r\n## Want to help out?\r\n\r\nIf you want to help bring Chaos to maturity, see\r\n[the issues page on Github](https://github.com/sdegutis/chaos/issues).
